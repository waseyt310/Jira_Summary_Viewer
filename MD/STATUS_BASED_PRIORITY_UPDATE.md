# 🎯 Status-Based Priority Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
Updated the Priority Dashboard to use **JIRA issue statuses** instead of priority field values, as requested. The dashboard now shows:
- **Current Priorities**: Issues with "In Progress" status
- **Up Next**: Issues with "To Do", "Open", "Backlog", or "Selected for Development" status

## ✅ **Key Changes Made**

### 1. **JQL Query Updates** (`config.py`)
```python
"CURRENT_PRIORITIES": "status = 'In Progress' ORDER BY updated DESC"
"UP_NEXT_PRIORITIES": "status in ('To Do', 'Open', 'Backlog', 'Selected for Development') ORDER BY created ASC"
```

**Previous Issue**: The JIRA instance doesn't have standard priority values like "High", "Medium", "Highest"
**Solution**: Use status-based filtering which is universal across all JIRA instances

### 2. **Dashboard Sections Redesigned**

#### **Current Priorities (In Progress)**
- **Definition**: All issues currently being worked on
- **Status Filter**: `status = 'In Progress'`
- **Ordering**: Most recently updated first
- **Purpose**: Shows active work requiring immediate attention

#### **Up Next (To Do)**
- **Definition**: Issues ready to be worked on
- **Status Filter**: `status in ('To Do', 'Open', 'Backlog', 'Selected for Development')`
- **Ordering**: Oldest created first (FIFO approach)
- **Purpose**: Shows queued work ready for assignment

### 3. **Table Structure Enhanced**
- **Priority Ranking**: Auto-generated based on order (1, 2, 3...)
- **Project**: Extracted from JIRA key (e.g., RPA-1452 → RPA)
- **JIRA ID**: Clickable links to issues
- **Status**: Current JIRA status
- **Start Date**: Issue creation date
- **Due Date**: JIRA due date (if set)
- **Est. Story Points**: JIRA story points field
- **Assigned To**: Formatted assignee names
- **Impact**: Uses actual JIRA priority field (if available)

### 4. **Improved Data Processing**
- **Better Assignee Formatting**: Converts emails to readable names
- **Robust Error Handling**: Handles missing fields gracefully
- **Status-Based Logic**: No dependency on priority field values

## 🎯 **Current Dashboard Features**

### **Section 1: Current Priorities (In Progress)**
```
🔥 Current Priorities (In Progress)
├── Shows all "In Progress" issues
├── Table format with essential columns
├── Ordered by most recently updated
├── Export to CSV functionality
└── Real-time issue count display
```

### **Section 2: Up Next (To Do)**
```
⏭️ Up Next (To Do)
├── Shows "To Do", "Open", "Backlog" issues
├── Same table format as current priorities
├── Ordered by creation date (oldest first)
├── Separate export functionality
└── Queue-style presentation for work planning
```

### **Section 3: Priority Summary**
```
📊 Priority Summary
├── Total current priorities count
├── Total up next count
├── Combined story points
└── Blocked issues alert
```

## 📊 **Data Sources & Logic**

### **Status Mapping**
| Dashboard Section | JIRA Status | Purpose |
|------------------|-------------|---------|
| Current Priorities | `In Progress` | Active work |
| Up Next | `To Do`, `Open`, `Backlog`, `Selected for Development` | Queued work |

### **Ordering Logic**
- **Current Priorities**: `ORDER BY updated DESC` (most recently updated first)
- **Up Next**: `ORDER BY created ASC` (oldest issues first - FIFO)

### **Table Columns Explained**
1. **Priority**: Auto-generated ranking (1, 2, 3...)
2. **Project**: Extracted from issue key
3. **JIRA ID**: Direct link to issue
4. **Status**: Current status
5. **Start Date**: When issue was created
6. **Due Date**: Target completion date
7. **Est. Story Points**: Effort estimation
8. **Act. Story Points**: Placeholder for actual effort
9. **Assigned To**: Who's working on it
10. **ETA**: Placeholder for estimated completion
11. **Impact**: Uses JIRA priority field if available

## 🚀 **Access the Updated Dashboard**

### **Current URL**: http://localhost:8505

### **Quick Start**
1. Double-click `run_dashboard.bat`
2. Navigate to Priority Dashboard tab
3. View status-based priority data

## 📈 **Expected Results**

### **Current Priorities Section**
- Issues currently being worked on
- Active development items
- Recently updated issues appear first
- Clear visibility of work in progress

### **Up Next Section**
- Issues ready for assignment
- Backlog items ready for development
- Oldest issues appear first (FIFO queue)
- Planning and sprint preparation items

## 🔧 **Customization Options**

### **Status Values** (in `config.py`)
```python
# Add or modify status values based on your JIRA workflow
"CURRENT_PRIORITIES": "status = 'In Progress' ORDER BY updated DESC"
"UP_NEXT_PRIORITIES": "status in ('To Do', 'Open', 'Backlog', 'Selected for Development') ORDER BY created ASC"
```

### **Additional Status Options**
You can customize the status values to match your JIRA workflow:
- **In Progress variants**: "In Development", "In Review", "Testing"
- **To Do variants**: "Ready for Development", "Sprint Backlog", "Approved"

### **Project Filtering** (Optional Enhancement)
```python
# Add project filtering if needed
"CURRENT_PRIORITIES": "status = 'In Progress' AND project in ('RPA', 'DEV') ORDER BY updated DESC"
```

## ✅ **Success Indicators**

- ✅ Priority dashboard shows actual JIRA issues
- ✅ Status-based filtering works correctly
- ✅ Current priorities show "In Progress" issues
- ✅ Up next shows "To Do" and related statuses
- ✅ Table format matches requirements
- ✅ Clickable JIRA links functional
- ✅ Export functionality operational
- ✅ Real-time data updates

## 🎉 **Result**

The Priority Dashboard now provides a clear, status-based view of work priorities:

1. **Current Priorities**: Shows what's actively being worked on
2. **Up Next**: Shows what's ready to be started
3. **Professional Table Format**: Easy to read and navigate
4. **Real-time Updates**: Reflects current JIRA state
5. **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any JIRA status configuration

This approach is more practical and universally applicable than priority field-based filtering, as it directly reflects the actual workflow status of issues.
