# Enhanced Priority Dashboard Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

The Priority Dashboard has been enhanced with specific criteria to provide a more focused view of urgent work items and future priorities. This implementation follows the exact requirements for **Tab 2: Priority Dashboard**.

## 📋 Enhanced Criteria

### Section 1: Current Priorities (Due This Week & In Progress)

**Definition:**
- Issues with **"In Progress"** status AND **due date within the current calendar week**
- Current week: **Monday to Sunday** (dynamically calculated)
- Example: May 26, 2025 to June 1, 2025

**Purpose:**
- Shows the most urgent items requiring immediate attention
- Focuses on work that is both active and time-sensitive
- Helps identify potential deadline risks

**Ordering:**
- Primary: Priority rank (1, 2, 3...)
- Secondary: Due Date (earliest first)

### Section 2: Up Next Priorities (To Do for Future Work)

**Definition:**
- Issues with **"To Do", "Open", "Backlog", or "Selected for Development"** status
- **Excludes** items due this week (focuses on future work)
- Includes items with due dates beyond current week OR no due date set

**Purpose:**
- Shows work ready to be picked up after current priorities
- Helps with sprint planning and resource allocation
- Provides visibility into the backlog

**Ordering:**
- Primary: Priority rank (1, 2, 3...)
- Secondary: Creation date (oldest first)

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### New Method: `get_enhanced_priority_issues()`

**Location:** `jira_client.py`

**Key Features:**
- Dynamic week calculation (Monday to Sunday)
- Enhanced JQL queries with date filtering
- Fallback to original method if enhanced criteria fails
- Full team member filtering support

**JQL Examples:**

**Current Priorities:**
```sql
(status = 'In Progress' AND duedate >= '2025-05-26' AND duedate <= '2025-06-01') 
AND (assignee = "user1@company.com" OR assignee = "user2@company.com") 
ORDER BY priority DESC, duedate ASC
```

**Up Next Priorities:**
```sql
(status in ('To Do', 'Open', 'Backlog', 'Selected for Development') 
AND (duedate > '2025-06-01' OR duedate is EMPTY)) 
AND (assignee = "user1@company.com" OR assignee = "user2@company.com") 
ORDER BY priority DESC, created ASC
```

### Enhanced UI Components

**Location:** `main.py` - `render_priority_dashboard_tab()`

**New Features:**
- Current week display with dynamic dates
- Enhanced section descriptions
- Better messaging for empty states
- Improved column tooltips and help text
