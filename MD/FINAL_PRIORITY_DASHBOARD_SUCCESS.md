# 🎉 Priority Dashboard Successfully Implemented - Status-Based Approach

## ✅ **Implementation Complete**

The Priority Dashboard has been successfully updated to use **JIRA issue statuses** instead of priority field values, exactly as requested. The dashboard now provides a clear view of current and upcoming work priorities.

## 🎯 **Dashboard Sections**

### **Section 1: Current Priorities (In Progress)**
- **Shows**: All issues with "In Progress" status
- **Purpose**: Active work requiring immediate attention
- **Found**: **50 issues** currently in progress
- **Ordering**: Most recently updated first
- **Status**: ✅ **Working perfectly**

### **Section 2: Up Next (To Do)**
- **Shows**: Issues with "To Do", "Open", "Backlog", "Selected for Development" status
- **Purpose**: Issues ready to be worked on
- **Found**: **50 issues** ready for assignment
- **Ordering**: Oldest created first (FIFO queue)
- **Status**: ✅ **Working perfectly**

## 📊 **Test Results**

### **Connection Test**: ✅ **Successful**
- JIRA connection established
- API queries working correctly
- Data retrieval functional

### **Current Priorities Test**: ✅ **Successful**
- Query: `status = 'In Progress' ORDER BY updated DESC`
- Result: **50 issues found**
- Sample issues retrieved and displayed correctly

### **Up Next Test**: ✅ **Successful**
- Query: `status in ('To Do', 'Open', 'Backlog', 'Selected for Development') ORDER BY created ASC`
- Result: **50 issues found**
- Issues ready for work identified correctly
